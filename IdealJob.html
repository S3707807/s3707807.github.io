								<p>The ideal job through researching and browsing online and looking at YouTube videos into the day of a life of a Project Manager and watching lectures and TED talks of project managers. I have come to a current conclusion for the time being that it is the most desirable role for me, the idea of a Digital Nomad gave me a spark of interest. The reason this position shot out at me was because it ties in so many skills areas, from developing, managing people and projects, extensive communication skills, consulting to sales and so much more. It is like a jack of all trades kind of job, no doubt there will be many tireless hours and thinking after hours but I do not want to be doing the same thing every day, I have found a position on Seek outlining exactly what I mean. <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/36942643?type=promoted">here</a></p
								<p>The skills and qualifications for this job are currently well out of my current skill set. I aim to learn how to plan and implement projects, lead teams, know to how to make sales, understand my self and how to grow and how I grow, gain invaluable experience and learn how to demonstrate independence. The job requires me to have multiple projects done, a successful track record with external clients and proven industry experience. </p>
								<p>Right now I do not have a lot of the experience required or many of the skills, one thing that I can highlight is that I have developed and gained invaluable customer servicing skills and how to tailor interactions and how to work in a team environment due to my time at NAB as a customer servicer over the phones. I am on my way to learning an essential requirement which is understanding of software and hardware. </p>
								<p>In terms of gaining the necessary experience and skills required, I have to be proactive, jumping at every chance that comes across me, I have to look to broaden my horizons  in the field of not only IT but also management. My current path is to do this Information Technology Bachelor, hopefully get into a IBL(industry based learning) offer through RMIT and gain invaluable experience. Then from there I will look to get into the base jobs, like analysing data, security and customer needs, do a degree in management, get in touch with project managers myself and show that I am interested and driven to be part of something bigger. Build connections and layout what I need. See where the ride takes me. </p
