								<p>Name: Russel Nawinna</p>
								<p>Student Number: s3707807</p>
								<p>Email Address: s3707807@student.rmit.edu</p>
								<p>Background Information:I am an Australian born Sri Lankan, so naturally I am an avid cricket fan and love a good curry. I speak Sinhalese at home and have previously studied at Monash University, I was studying a Science degree down there but could not really find a spark in myself to keep on trudging along with it, I could not see myself in the field in the next ten years, I was after a bit more diversity and change and Information Technology really was standing out as I found myself intrigued by my friends working on their assignments. The coding aspects and the all round skills they were doing on tasks, ranging from coding to management to implementation and just seemed like a field with a lot of opportunities and so naturally I figured there is a higher chance that I will be able to find something that I love doing hence this assignment is taking me towards realising that a little bit at least, so I enrolled in a couple IT units where I learnt the basics of Java, HTML and few other language and have not looked back since. I saw RMIT as an opportunity to follow that dream and set myself on my way. I feel goals are not as important as the process, I mean you may get to do something you absolutely love but if it was ten years of painstaking effort, I would rather not, rather the process be as enjoyable as the end product but of course that end product will be that much sweeter. </p>
													
								<p>In terms of hobbies, I like to try my hand at a few sports, cricket, tennis, soccer or any sport really, I may be a little sub-par but I like the challenge, it is mentally and physically challenging. But aside from the all that I am a Buddhist and find myself questioning life and the reality that we live in the most, and that was another reason I got into Information Technology, it was another way of looking at the world, OOP really did open my eyes as to how you conceptually visualise a world </p>
