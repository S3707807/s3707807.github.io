								<p>My interest in IT was sparked by the world around me, as it is increasingly a digital world in which we inhabit, IT has made the world a more visceral place through a screen from live shows, to games, to movies, music and connecting with people and things in a way never imagined before. One of my close friends, Richard, really sparked the flame though, he is three years into his IT degree already and was constantly on my back and always showing me things that were literally changing the world and how he is becoming part of it as well through graduate programs that are offered in universities. Through his advice and display of the IT world I chose to do a couple units on coding which is more behind the scenes because if you are not in the backend of the whole set up you do not see anything but the user interfaces, you may have a general idea of where things may be going in terms of advancement, but do not exactly know how fast we are moving along. After doing this Java unit I got an idea of how broad IT is as an industry, from coding to design to management to security to projects and the vast fields that IT has to offer in the coming years as even more jobs are going to be opening with the Artificial Intelligence movement</p>
								<p>I chose to come to RMIT as I believe that RMIT delivers a well-rounded Bachelor of IT which covers a lot of areas which you can hone in on and develop when you enter the professional field. RMIT offers micro credentials, graduate programs, structured pathways to learning many areas of the IT field, even my first year doing this assignment I have already earmarked a position as a very likely route for me to go down, Project Management sounds very intriguing.  </p>
								<p>During my studies at RMIT I really do hope to go into the working field, more equipped to make a difference and really push the boundaries, whether it be through channels such as Block Chain, the Internet of Thing or Artificial Intelligence, I want to have a solid base of knowledge and skills so by the time I am done by degree, I have a more mapped out idea of exactly where I want to but you never know what the future holds.</p>
