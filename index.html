								<p>I am an Australian born Sri Lankan so naturally I am an avid cricket fan and love a good curry. I speak Sinhalese at home and have previously studied at Monash University, I was studying a Science degree down there but couldn’t really find a spark in myself to keep on trudging along with it, I couldn’t see myself in the field in the next ten years, I was after a bit more diversity and change and Information Technology really was standing out as I found myself intrigued by my friends working on their assignments. The coding aspects and the all round skills they were doing on tasks, ranging from coding to management to implementation and just seemed like a field with a lot of opportunities and so naturally I figured there is a higher chance that I will be able to find something that I love doing hence this assignment is taking me towards realising that a little bit at least, so I enrolled in a couple IT units where I learnt the basics of Java, HTML and few other language and haven’t looked back since. I saw RMIT as an opportunity to follow that dream and set myself on my way. I feel goals are not as important as the process, I mean you may get to do something you absolutely love but if it was ten years of painstaking effort, I’d rather not, I’d rather the process be as enjoyable as the end product but of course that end product will be that much sweeter. </p>

										<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
										<p>What intrigues me about the world of IT?</p>

								<p>My interest in IT was sparked by the world around me, as it is increasingly a digital world in which we inhabit, IT has made the world a more visceral place through a screen from live shows, to games, to movies, music and connecting with people and things in a way never imagined before. One of my close friends, Richard, really sparked the flame though, he is three years into his IT degree already and was constantly on my back and always showing me things that were literally changing the world and how he is becoming part of it as well through graduate programs that are offered in universities. Through his advice and display of the IT world I chose to do a couple units on coding which is more behind the scenes because if you’re not in the backend of the whole set up you don’t see anything but the user interfaces, you may have a general idea of where things may be going in terms of advancement, but don’t exactly know how fast we are moving along. After doing this Java unit I got an idea of how broad IT is as an industry, from coding to design to management to security to projects and the vast fields that IT has to offer in the coming years as even more jobs are going to be opening with the Artificial Intelligence movement.</p>
								<p>I chose to come to RMIT as I believe that RMIT delivers a well-rounded Bachelor of IT which covers a lot of areas which you can hone in on and develop when you enter the professional field. RMIT offers micro credentials, graduate programs, structured pathways to learning many areas of the IT field, even my first year doing this assignment I’ve already earmarked a position as a very likely route for me to go down, Project Management sounds very intriguing. During my studies at RMIT I really do hope to go into the working field, more equipped to make a difference and really push the boundaries, whether it be through channels such as Block Chain, the Internet of Thing or Artificial Intelligence, I want to have a solid base of knowledge and skills so by the time I am done by degree, I have a more mapped out idea of exactly where I want to but you never know what the future holds. </p>

										<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
										<p>What the future holds</p>

								<p>The ideal job through researching and browsing online and looking at YouTube videos into the day of a life of a Project Manager and watching lectures and TED talks of project managers. I have come to a current conclusion for the time being that it is the most desirable role for me, the idea of a Digital Nomad gave me a spark of interest. The reason this position shot out at me was because it ties in so many skills areas, from developing software, working on hardware managing people and projects, extensive communication skills, consulting to sales and so much more. It is like a jack of all trades kind of job, no doubt there will be many tireless hours and thinking after hours but I do not want to be doing the same thing every day, I have found a position on Seek outlining exactly what I mean. <a href=" https://www.seek.com.au/job/36942643?type=promoted">here</a></p>
								<p>The skills and qualifications for this job are currently well out of my current skill set. I aim to learn how to plan and implement projects, lead teams, know to how to make sales, understand my self and how to grow and how I grow, gain invaluable experience and learn how to demonstrate independence. The job requires me to have multiple projects done, a successful track record with external clients 	and proven industry experience. </p>
								<p>Right now I don’t have a lot of the experience required or many of the skills, one thing that I can highlight is that I have developed and gained invaluable customer servicing skills and how to tailor interactions and how to work in a team environment due to my time at NAB as a customer servicer over the phones. I am on my way to learning an essential requirement which is understanding of software and hardware. </p>
								<p>In terms of gaining the necessary experience and skills required, I have to be proactive, jumping at every chance that comes across me, I have to look to broaden my horizons  in the field of not only IT but also management. My current path is to do this Information Technology Bachelor, hopefully get into a IBL(industry based learning) offer through RMIT and gain invaluable experience. Then from there I will look to get into the base jobs, like analysing data, security and customer needs, do a degree in management, get in touch with project managers myself and show that I am interested and driven to be part of something bigger. Build connections and layout what I need. See where the ride takes me.</p>

										<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
										<p>what online test's tell me and what i should do</p>

								<p>I have done a learning test from EducationPlanner.com, a personality test from 16Personalities.com and a creativity test from testmycreativity.com. I have learn that as a learner I am 40% auditory, 30% visual and 30% tactile therefore more of a auditory learner. My creativity score turned out to be a 52.65 a little on the lower side I must admit. My personality test produced a result of an Entertainer technically known as ESFP-A, with the qualities of being extroverted, observant, more of a prospector than a judger and assertive. </p>
								<p>These learning tests gave me more insight to myself and how I should track where I am going, being an auditory learner, I feel that I am more of a learner through discussions, group environments, relaying ideas back and forth, my creativity test gave me an idea of where I really do lie and that’s more towards the management area as there is less creativity but then again it’s not all flops so I feel that I can give some necessary creative input. My personality test though really set in stone as to what sort of path I should try taking as it is outlined, in my eyes all the necessary attributes that are required of a project manager or a position of there or thereabouts. </p>
								<p>Given this information, I should be taking this into account in the following ways, I should not put down any input from anyone that is looking to make a positive contribution to an idea, I should be as guided as I can be as to allocation tasks and knowing what the general result is going to look like. It doesn’t necessarily matter as to what sort of group I am in as I am sure that I can hatch up a conversation with many of the group members. </p>

										<h2>Project Ideas</h2>

								<p>Block Chain along with Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence have come along way and are earmarked to make a rapid change in the future. I would like to focus on one main point of discussion, the implementation of blockchain in various social circumstances but mainly in banks as it is going to have a major impact on the area of banks specifically. Blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt the world of banking through facilitating global money remittance also known as digital currency and other aspects such as smart contracts</p>
								<p>The main set of skills required to for embarking on a project like this is to have developers that can manipulate and change the code for the necessary software and know what type of hardware is required, for this sort of project that is implementing block chain into mass corporations like banks you have to know how to implement it so it covers every area that is deemed necessary for integrity and security. For a blockchain project like this you need to know how to set up a system so that everything is fully managed hence experience in databases are necessary. The whole idea of blockchain is to decentralise everything so that transactions as they are called are done through ledgers and smart contracts which are technical terms in block chain basically meaning that a change needs to be approved by a certain network for the change to go through. </p>
								<p>A study by Accenture in October 2016 displayed that there are at least 9 out of every 10 banking professionals who know about the rapid rise of blockchain technology and have already begun implementing this into their systems to make sure that they are keeping up to date and are more than ready when the technological revolution takes place and is a mainstay. Many of these professionals have understood that the way cryptocurrency works as it is a branch in blockchain technology it will interrupt the modern infrastructure and way of thinking and will require major remedial changes in the current setup. In response to these sort of advancements, as an attempt to stay up to date and remain competitive have tried to become security areas for cryptocurrency transactions, although this may be short lived as mentioned before the infrastructure set up isn’t fully set up to be like that. </p>
								<p>Blockchain is the technology that will decentralise any database and how it can change the way banks work is by literally flipping their paradigm completely as all banks are known to consist of a centralised banking infrastructure. The problem with this sort of set up is that if a hacker or an intruder attempts to infiltrate and corrupt data and steal them all they have to do is access the main point or the central data. Once they have access to this, customers information and other details are at great risk, so understanding how to change the technology in a way that makes it decentralised is imperative. Security peaks as when a potential attacker comes through they have to attack multiple points at once, as the basis of blockchain technology is that every “node” as they are called have all that data that every other node does therefore it makes it much more difficult for an attacker to infiltrate data and make major changes. </p>
								<p>Software that is on the rise right now for blockchain are platforms like Ethereum, Rubix, Oracle Blockchain, Azure blockchain workbench and IBM blockchain. These sort of platforms along with cryptocurrency products like BitPay, Binance, Coinbase, Coinhive and Bitifinex. For a project to go forth as mentioned before these are the main software required and you need a whole team of workers who can implement and understand the code as well as making a database for the whole organisation.</p>
								<p>In a bank put simply how money works is that you have a currency, you give that to a trusted person to hold; the bank or the ledger then after that you have a settlement process that comes afterwards. The problem in current days is that it is a very arduous task to keep track of a transaction and monitor it as there isn’t enough people that know about the transaction. What happens when a blockchain is implemented is that, a whole network knows about that transaction and that can be verified if any sort of difficulty is to happen</p>
								<p>Banks are then able to begin to streamline their current systems in order to create a cut down on costs across many areas that is proving much too costly for them at the moment. When becoming digitised and more automated, many functions become defunct that cost companies billions, one such example is the cost and money put into security, it will remove north of 9-10 billion dollars according to Assenture, funds that can be allocated to other areas of business and development. Another major social implication that this may have is, it will cut down the competition between major corporations such as that like banks from NAB to Commbank to Westpac, besides all this loss in competition and how to store money in a proper framework, banks are staring right in the face of extinction, it may mean that many people lose jobs and what not but what it also brings along is new jobs. Jobs that are designed for the future.</p>
								<p>Going a bit deeper into the whole blockchain revolution, if all major banks in business now are looking to streamline their business models by implementing blockchain technology, banking positions that will be on the line are as follows. There will be no need for fraud and risk analytics, wire specialists, bank tellers or clerks, branches will literally be defunct. Blockchain will take out these types of jobs. To provide more context as a whole on the revolution, currently occupying 168000 positions in banking Australia is the broader finance and risk insurance sector making up a number which produces the 11th largest employer in Australia alone. </p>
