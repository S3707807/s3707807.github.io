								<p>Block Chain along with Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence have come along way and are earmarked to make a rapid change in the future. I would like to focus on one main point of discussion, the implementation of blockchain in various social circumstances but mainly in banks as it is going to have a major impact on the area of banks specifically. Blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt the world of banking through facilitating global money remittance also known as digital currency and other aspects such as smart contracts.</p>
								<p>The main set of skills required to for embarking on a project like this is to have developers that can manipulate and change the code for the necessary software and know what type of hardware is required, for this sort of project that is implementing block chain into mass corporations like banks you have to know how to implement it so it covers every area that is deemed necessary for integrity and security. For a blockchain project like this you need to know how to set up a system so that everything is fully managed hence experience in databases are necessary. The whole idea of blockchain is to decentralise everything so that transactions as they are called are done through ledgers and smart contracts which are technical terms in block chain basically meaning that a change needs to be approved by a certain network for the change to go through. </p>
								<p>A study by Accenture in October 2016 displayed that there are at least 9 out of every 10 banking professionals who know about the rapid rise of blockchain technology and have already begun implementing this into their systems to make sure that they are keeping up to date and are more than ready when the technological revolution takes place and is a mainstay. Many of these professionals have understood that the way cryptocurrency works as it is a branch in blockchain technology it will interrupt the modern infrastructure and way of thinking and will require major remedial changes in the current setup. In response to these sort of advancements, as an attempt to stay up to date and remain competitive have tried to become security areas for cryptocurrency transactions, although this may be short lived as mentioned before the infrastructure set up is not fully set up to be like that. </p>
								<p>Blockchain is the technology that will decentralise any database and how it can change the way banks work is by literally flipping their paradigm completely as all banks are known to consist of a centralised banking infrastructure. The problem with this sort of set up is that if a hacker or an intruder attempts to infiltrate and corrupt data and steal them all they have to do is access the main point or the central data. Once they have access to this, customers information and other details are at great risk, so understanding how to change the technology in a way that makes it decentralised is imperative. Security peaks as when a potential attacker comes through they have to attack multiple points at once, as the basis of blockchain technology is that every node as they are called have all that data that every other node does therefore it makes it much more difficult for an attacker to infiltrate data and make major changes</p>
								<p>Software that is on the rise right now for blockchain are platforms like Ethereum, Rubix, Oracle Blockchain, Azure blockchain workbench and IBM blockchain. These sort of platforms along with cryptocurrency products like BitPay, Binance, Coinbase, Coinhive and Bitifinex. For a project to go forth as mentioned before these are the main software required and you need a whole team of workers who can implement and understand the code as well as making a database for the whole organisation. </p>
								<p>In a bank put simply how money works is that you have a currency, you give that to a trusted person to hold; the bank or the ledger then after that you have a settlement process that comes afterwards. The problem in current days is that it is a very arduous task to keep track of a transaction and monitor it as there is not enough people that know about the transaction. What happens when a blockchain is implemented is that, a whole network knows about that transaction and that can be verified if any sort of difficulty is to happen</p>
								<p>Banks are then able to begin to streamline their current systems in order to create a cut down on costs across many areas that is proving much too costly for them at the moment. When becoming digitised and more automated, many functions become defunct that cost companies billions, one such example is the cost and money put into security, it will remove north of 9-10 billion dollars according to Assenture, funds that can be allocated to other areas of business and development. Another major social implication that this may have is, it will cut down the competition between major corporations such as that like banks from NAB to Commbank to Westpac, besides all this loss in competition and how to store money in a proper framework, banks are staring right in the face of extinction, it may mean that many people lose jobs and what not but what it also brings along is new jobs. Jobs that are designed for the future.</p>
								<p>Going a bit deeper into the whole blockchain revolution, if all major banks in business now are looking to streamline their business models by implementing blockchain technology, banking positions that will be on the line are as follows. There will be no need for fraud and risk analytics, wire specialists, bank tellers or clerks, branches will literally be defunct. Blockchain will take out these types of jobs. To provide more context as a whole on the revolution, currently occupying 168000 positions in banking Australia is the broader finance and risk insurance sector making up a number which produces the 11th largest employer in Australia alone</p>
